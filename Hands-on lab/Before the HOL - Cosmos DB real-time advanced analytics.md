# Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription, must be a pay-as-you subscription).
2. **IMPORTANT**: To complete the OAuth 2.0 access components of this hands-on lab you must have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

In the Before the hands-on lab exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Download the starter files

Download a starter project that includes a payment data generator that sends real-time payment data for processing by your lab solution, as well as data files used in the lab.

1. Download the starter files by downloading a .zip copy of the Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics GitHub repo.

2. In a web browser, navigate to the [Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics MCW repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Cosmos-DB-Real-Time-Advanced-Analytics).

3. On the repo page, select **Clone or download**, then select **Download ZIP**.

   ![Download .zip containing the repository](media/git-hub-download-repo.png 'Download ZIP')

4. Unzip the contents to the folder `C:\CosmosMCW\`.

### Task 2: Download and install Power BI Desktop

Power BI desktop is required to make a connection to your Azure Databricks environment when creating the Power BI dashboard.

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### Task 3: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, select **+Add**, and then enter the following in the Create a resource group blade:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group name**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.

   - **Region**: Select the region you would like to use for resources in this hands-on lab. Remember this location so you can use it for the other resources you'll provision throughout this lab.

     ![Add Resource group Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, +Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and "hands-on-labs" is entered into the Resource group name box on the Create an empty resource group blade.](./media/create-resource-group.png 'Create resource group')

2. Select **Review + create**.

3. On the Summary blade, select **Create** to provision your resource group.

### Task 4: Deploy Environment

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (press the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FMCW-Cosmos-DB-Real-Time-Advanced-Analytics%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2FDeployment%2Fenvironment-template.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" /></a>

2. Enter the following values, then select **Review + create**:

   - Resource group: **Select the Resource Group created previously for the lab**.
   - Unique Suffix: **Enter a unique value, such as your initials followed by birth year**.
   - Autoscale Max Throughput: **Enter 4000 as the max RU/s for the Azure Cosmos DB containers**.

   ![The parameters specified are highlighted.](media/deploy-deployment-parameter-fields.png 'The parameters specified are highlighted')

3. Select **Create** on the `Review + create` form.

    ![The review page is displayed.](media/deploy-review.png "Review + create")

    ![The deployment progress is shown.](media/deploy-deployment-progress.png 'The deployment progress is shown')

You should follow all steps provided _before_ performing the Hands-on lab.
